<blockquote>CSS Grid: Reduce Repetition Using the repeat Function
    When you used grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows to define the structure of a grid, you entered a value
    for each row or column you created.

    Let's say you want a grid with 100 rows of the same height. It isn't very practical to insert 100 values
    individually. Fortunately, there's a better way - by using the repeat function to specify the number of times you
    want your column or row to be repeated, followed by a comma and the value you want to repeat.

    Here's an example that would create the 100 row grid, each row at 50px tall.
    <br>
    <code>grid-template-rows: repeat(100, 50px);</code>
    You can also repeat multiple values with the repeat function and insert the function amongst other values when
    defining a grid structure. Here's what that looks like:

    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr 50px) 20px;
    This translates to:
    <br>
    <code>grid-template-columns: 1fr 50px 1fr 50px 20px;</code>
    Note: The 1fr 50px is repeated twice followed by 20px.</blockquote>
