<blockquote>The HTML tabindex attribute has three distinct functions relating to an element's keyboard focus. When it's
    on a tag, it indicates that element can be focused on. The value (an integer that's positive, negative, or zero)
    determines the behavior.

    Certain elements, such as links and form controls, automatically receive keyboard focus when a user tabs through a
    page. It's in the same order as the elements come in the HTML source markup. This same functionality can be given to
    other elements, such as div, span, and p, by placing a tabindex="0" attribute on them.

    Applied Accessibility: Use tabindex to Specify the Order of Keyboard Focus for Several Elements
    The tabindex attribute also specifies the exact tab order of elements. This is achieved when the value of the
    attribute
    is set to a positive number of 1 or higher.

    Setting a tabindex="1" will bring keyboard focus to that element first. Then it cycles through the sequence of
    specified
    tabindex values (2, 3, etc.), before moving to default and tabindex="0" items.

    It's important to note that when the tab order is set this way, it overrides the default order (which uses the HTML
    source). This may confuse users who are expecting to start navigation from the top of the page. This technique may
    be
    necessary in some circumstances, but in terms of accessibility, take care before applying it.

    Here's an example:</blockquote>

<div tabindex="1">I get keyboard focus, and I get it first!</div>

<div tabindex="2">I get keyboard focus, and I get it second!</div>
<p tabindex=0>Instructions: Fill in ALL your information then click <b>Submit</b></p>
