<blockquote>The HTML tabindex attribute has three distinct functions relating to an element's keyboard focus. When it's
    on a tag, it indicates that element can be focused on. The value (an integer that's positive, negative, or zero)
    determines the behavior.

    Certain elements, such as links and form controls, automatically receive keyboard focus when a user tabs through a
    page. It's in the same order as the elements come in the HTML source markup. This same functionality can be given to
    other elements, such as div, span, and p, by placing a tabindex="0" attribute on them</blockquote>
