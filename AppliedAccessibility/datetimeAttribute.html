<blockquote style="line-height: 30px;">Continuing with the date theme, HTML5 also introduced the time element along with
    a datetime attribute to standardize times. This is an inline element that can wrap a date or time on a page. A valid
    format of that date is held by the datetime attribute. This is the value accessed by assistive devices. It helps
    avoid confusion by stating a standardized version of a time, even if it's written in an informal or colloquial
    manner in the text.</blockquote>
