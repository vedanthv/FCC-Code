<blockquote style="line-height: 35px;">HTML offers the accesskey attribute to specify a shortcut key to activate or
    bring focus to an element. This can make navigation more efficient for keyboard-only users.

    HTML5 allows this attribute to be used on any element, but it's particularly useful when it's used with interactive
    ones. This includes links, buttons, and form controls. </blockquote>

<button accesskey="b">Important Button</button>
