<blockquote style="line-height:35px;"> introduced the figure element, along with the related figcaption. Used together,
    these items wrap a visual representation (like an image, diagram, or chart) along with its caption. This gives a
    two-fold accessibility boost by both semantically grouping related content, and providing a text alternative that
    explains the figure.</blockquote>
