<!-- It doesn't matter which order the classes are listed in the HTML element.

However, the order of the class declarations in the <style> section is what is important. The second declaration will always take precedence over the first. Because .blue-text is declared second, it overrides the attributes of .pink-text -->

<style>
    body {
        background-color: black;
        color: green;
        font-family: monospace;
    }

    .pink-text {
        color: pink;
    }
    .blue-text{
        color:blue;
    }

</style>

<body>
    <h1 class="pink-text blue-text">Hello World</h1>
</body>
