<!-- Bootstrap comes with several pre-defined colors for buttons. The btn-info class is used to call attention to optional actions that the user can take.

Create a new block-level Bootstrap button below your "Like" button with the text "Info", and add Bootstrap's btn-info and btn-block classes to it.

Note that these buttons still need the btn and btn-block classes. -->

<button class="btn btn-block btn-info">Info</button>
