<blockquote>CSS treats each HTML element as its own box, which is usually referred to as the CSS Box Model. Block-level
    items
    automatically start on a new line (think headings, paragraphs, and divs) while inline items sit within surrounding
    content (like images or spans). The default layout of elements in this way is called the normal flow of a document,
    but CSS offers the position property to override it.

    When the position of an element is set to relative, it allows you to specify how CSS should move it relative to its
    current position in the normal flow of the page. It pairs with the CSS offset properties of left or right, and top
    or bottom. These say how many pixels, percentages, or ems to move the item away from where it is normally
    positioned. The following example moves the paragraph 10 pixels away from the bottom:</blockquote>
<blockquote>Positioning does not affes the elements coming afterwards. It does not disturb the normal flow of the
    document</blockquote>

<h1>On Being Well-Positioned</h1>
<h2>Move me !</h2>
<p>I still think the h2 is where it normally sits.
