<!-- When adding another element it must be given a value of static(default) other than the postition attribute of the child element -->
<!-- If the parser cannot find a avsolte element it will do to any element other than default,if it does not find that,the style will be the style of the body tag -->
<blockquote>The next option for the CSS position property is absolute, which locks the element in place relative to its
    parent container. Unlike the relative position, this removes the element from the normal flow of the document, so
    surrounding items ignore it. The CSS offset properties (top or bottom and left or right) are used to adjust the
    position.

    One nuance with absolute positioning is that it will be locked relative to its closest positioned ancestor. If you
    forget to add a position rule to the parent item, (this is typically done using position: relative;), the browser
    will keep looking up the chain and ultimately default to the body tag.</blockquote>
