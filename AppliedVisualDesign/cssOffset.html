<blockquote> CSS offsets of top or bottom, and left or right tell the browser how far to offset an item relative to
    where it would sit in the normal flow of the document. You're offsetting an element away from a given spot, which
    moves the element away from the referenced side (effectively, the opposite direction). As you saw in the last
    challenge, using the top offset moved the h2 downwards. Likewise, using a left offset moves an item to the right.
