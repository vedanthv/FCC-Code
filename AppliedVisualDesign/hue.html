    <blockquote>Hue is what people generally think of as 'color'. If you picture a spectrum of colors starting with red
        on
        the left, moving through green in the middle, and blue on right, the hue is where a color fits along this line.
        In
        hsl(), hue uses a color wheel concept instead of the spectrum, where the angle of the color on the circle is
        given
        as a value between 0 and 360.

        Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. A fully saturated color has no gray in it, and a minimally
        saturated
        color is almost completely gray. This is given as a percentage with 100% being fully saturated.

        Lightness is the amount of white or black in a color. A percentage is given ranging from 0% (black) to 100%
        (white),
        where 50% is the normal color. </blockquote>
